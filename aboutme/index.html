    <h2>Paul Kuczak</h2>
    <p>Hi Everyone! My name is Paul and I'm from Toronto, Canada. I'm 32 years old and am married to my beautiful wife that is very supportive of me and my decision to further my education. I'm very excited to start this journey with all of you.</p>
    <p>I'm working towards a Bachelor's Degree in Applied Technology, hoping to focus my career to the software develpment field. I currently work as an IT Project Coordinator for a service company, but really want to get into the creative side of the IT sector rather than administration.</p>
    <p>I really enjoy a wide variety of activities and hobbies. I love to play (recreationally) all kinds of sports, but not watch them. I like to hike, camp, and explore national parks and landmarks. Coming inside, I've really been into building computers and personal servers for myself and for friends; it feels like another version of adult lego for me. I meet weekly with friends to play all kinds of table top and board games.</p>
    <p>I'm really looking forward to meeting you all and hearing everyone's great thoughts and ideas. Thanks for taking some time to get to know a little about me!</p>
