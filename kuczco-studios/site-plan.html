      <h2>
        Content
      </h2>
      <h3>Home page</h3>
      <p>
        I think there will be 3 main questions that most visitors will want answered. Who is the photographer and what is their style? How much will it cost? How do I book a session?
        People will come to this site because they are seeking a talented photographer for an upcoming event, a date, or family reason.The focus of the services will be towards portraits mostly; this can include personal, newborn, couple, engagement, family, etc.The home page will need to be very modern, clean, and elegant. I want the logo to be transparent, top, and center of the page. The navigation will split to either side of the logo. One hero image will fill the entire page, though a carousel would be nice if I can learn how to do that. In the carouselled images, I would like each to represent the different events/services offered, with the type of that event on each image. The footer will be simple, likely with the same nav links as the header just in a different format. It will also have the proper social links, as well as a few keywords related to the services offered (for at-a-glance purposes, as well as SEO reasons).
        I would like to have a third child page for an About Me page, but I was thinking to condense that and add it to the wireframe of the home page to add a little more detail to that page.

      </ul>
      <h3>Gallery</h3>
      <p>
        The interaction flow will likely start at the Home Page, then go to the Gallery. A Gallery page will one hundred percent be required as that is going to showcase the style and vision of the photographer. This is what every client will want to have access to. The main activity for most people will be viewing the galleries that will be used for the advertised portfolio. It might be worthwhile to have separate galleries for different event types, but it could be more interactive if it was a large scrollable gallery with everything and then the “selectable galleries” simply filter the images on the page. An “About Me” page or maybe section in the homepage is integral though it will not always be interacted with (compared to the gallery).
        The reason people would come to this site would be for the photographer’s style. Links to socials are very important here, and this is where the “About Me” page or section would really need to shine. Event and portrait photography is a very personal and personable business, so helping the client feel comfortable and trusting would be very important.

        <img src="images/lozadas-baby-small.jpg" alt="gallery image 4">
      </ul>
      <h3>Contact Us</h3>
      <p>
        After the Gallery, they would then go to the Contact page as they will need to communicate directly with the company to book an event. The “contact us” page can be kept simple with the company phone number, email, and socials, but it can develop into an interactable page where you can provide details about yourself (the user), your event date(s), and then a text/email box that could be used for the user to type a message, request, questions, etc. Some other questions might be related to services not explicitly listed on the site, such as “Do you shoot weddings?”, “ Will you shoot a corporate event?”, or “What area do you cover/Are you willing to travel?”. So those could be on a FAQ page. Since we are currently only focusing on 2 child pages, I won’t be able to do all of them. I’ll likely not do a page for pricing, drop the page for FAQs, and simply have them go through a Contact Us page to negotiate cost and a date and ask any further questions.

      <h2>
        Wireframes
      </h2>
      <p>
        Create three wireframes for your site. One for each page and list them here</p>

      <h3>Home</h3>
      <p>         
        This page will have a hero image carousel, a header/navigation bar (with a logo) that is centered, an about me section with a button to the Contact Us page, and an image section with a button to the gallery. The footer will include 2 social links, the header links, and copyright.
      </p>

      <h3>Gallery</h3>
      <p>         
        This page is going to purely be images in a gallery. They will be in a flexible format, so the actual arrangement of the photos may not appear in that specific pattern. This will make it simpler for the site owner when adding or removing photos within the gallery. As you hover over each image, it will expand and become a little larger for a better viewing experience.
      </p>

      <h3>Contact Us</h3>
      <p>         
        This page is very clear and simple. It includes manual contact info if the client wishes to use their own app or method of contact, or they can use the built in message form.
