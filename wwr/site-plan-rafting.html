    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <h3>Purpose</h3>
    <p>The purpose of this website is to provide information regarding Dry Oar's services, activities, and pricing. Customers will often pass on a company or service for other competitors if they do not have a website because customers prefer a simple and independant way to learn about your company without having to wait on the phone. This will lead to higher customer acquisition, resulting in increased revenue.</p>

    <h3>Audience</h3>
    <p>The site should be focused towards family oriented adults, particularly parents with pre-teen to teenage children. It should provide them the assurance that the activities look fun and safe for everyone. They will be an outdoors loving family, potentially looking for summer programs and camps for their children, or day activities for the whole family. The colors will need to have some vibrancy, but focus on water and earthy palettes. Both mobiles and desktops will be commonly used. Desktop will be mostly focused on when parents are planning large trips or summer programs. Mobile will be more common for looking up information on the go or looking for a day use.</p>

    <h3>Color Palette</h3>

Follow the instructions on the activity in Canvas then return and replace the color codes below with the hex color codes (the 6 digit numbers that show at the bottom of each color) for the colors you have chosen below.  You should have at least 2 colors but do not have to fill in all 4 if you do not need them.  -->

    <!-- Copy and paste the URL to your finished palette below. Replace the href value that is there with yours. Make sure to paste it into both the href value and the content text of the <a> tag -->
